# State-Space-models-and-Sequential-Monte-Carlo-Methods

This repo shows the work I did for the lecture of State Space Models of Nicolas Chopin at ENSAE. I implemented the article of Olivier Gu√©ant and Jiang Pu, Mid-price estimation for European corporate bonds: a particle filtering approach (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05884). You can find the notebook and the report of the project.
